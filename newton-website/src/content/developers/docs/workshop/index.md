## ## Introduction

Welcome to the Newton Community Workshop! Here, we look at Newton’s new technology innovation from different perspectives. By learning to find and exploit various issues, you'll be able to touch more directions of science & technology & design products & community as you'll know what to watch out for.

***Participants:***
•	 Developers
•	Designers
•	Researchers
•	Customer implementers
•	Test engineers
•	Infrastructure operators
•	Community organizers
•	Social economists
•	Artists
•	And so on

***Tech-focused/community focused:***
•	UX & Design
•	Scaling
•	Security
•	Privacy
•	Diversity
•	EIPs
•	Non-for-profit / blockchain-for-social-good
•	(Digital) Art / NFT
•	Fun & Games
•	And so on 

***Noted:***
Much of the code you see during this workshop is intentionally vulnerable. Even if the bugs are fixed, the code does not follow good design guidelines. Please do us a favor and not use it outside of security demonstrations.


## Who We Are

The team at Newton community understands that blockchain is a rapidly changing environment, so we always pay attention to and update our scientific and technological strengths, carry out innovative work, and build a talented team. To be a valued voice within the Newton ecosystem and advocate for Newton to the outside world. Our experts are not just working in the background; and they are actively leading everyone to explore new blockchain concepts and technologies.  We adapt quickly to challenges by collaborating with other teams and doing what we can.  All this allows us to develop a more substantial economic community and continue to drive the science technology design products community forward.

## Previous workshop

***Workshop #01: [EVT is coming](https://www.newtonproject.org/announcement/2022/08/04/newton-workshop-evt-coming/)***
You can watch the presentation on YouTube and follow along in the workshop recording.

If you need them for details, please refer to:
EVT will become an alternative to NFTs in the virtual and physical worlds, which was released under the [GPLv3]( https://github.com/newtonproject/evt-lib ). It's greater than NFTs, and its variability breaks down the current innovation barriers for virtual worlds. It is more encrypted and has complete traceability; for example, every time change will be securely recorded on the blockchain. This event is the first time in the industry to publicize the application and create EVT, knowing it will unlock your wealth password. EVT allows the implementation of standard APIs in smart contracts that is traceable, transferable, and encrypted while having dynamic properties, which means it can realize your dream of raising plants in the Metaverse, witness the birth and growth of various magical animals, and allow your feelings to be more accurate in the Metaverse. Simultaneously, it can solve the problem of copying artistic works and film works caused by the openness and ease of copying of NFTs. It provides a unique guarantee for the physical world: "Negative value" assets — loans, burdens, and other responsibilities.

## Ongoing Workshop

To make workshops hands-on, you will find them useful and develop exploring for them yourself.

We have prepared a few pieces of information for reference. As this workshop was intended for a few hours online, we have simplified exploring the science & technology & design products & community’s future with experts from worldwide. This allows you to focus on finding and exploring code-engineering functionality.

In the same vein, we have opted not to use the same framework as normal, even though it usually leads to secure contracts. We are committed to applying more secure, decentralized, and innovative science and technology design products. 

In an innovation, lots of unknowns are hidden behind, and we often have to go digging in to understand what exactly is being hidden and what can be dug out. 

## Kind tips
•	All invitees to this event are free to participate, and the event is open to the public, regardless of whether you know the science technology design products community. 
•	For users who participate in the event, if you want to know more about specific details, please enter Telegram or follow the official Twitter to communicate with us by private message. https://t.me/Newtonproject 
•	When the workshop opens, the announcement will be released on the official [website]( https://www.newtonproject.org/en/ ).
